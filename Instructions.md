Project Goals
This project aims to develop a suite of Python functions that interact with the Microsoft Graph API to automate all aspects of reading and sending emails in Outlook. The functions will then be used in a AI agent toolset to send and read emails.


API Documentation Usage
"Use only the provided API documentation to create the functions; do not include code that is not specified in the documentation."

Function Requirements
Should be able to send and read emails.
should be setup to work with OPEN AI Assistant or other Agentic LLMs
Should be able to handle large datasets of emails or singluar emails
Should include any other features or specific instructions as needed and identified in the API documentation.

Project Files Creation
"Create suitable project files, including a README.md with instructions on setting up and using the tools, specifying required tokens or access keys."

Testing Instructions
"Develop a comprehensive test suite that users can run to confirm their environment is correctly configured and that the API functions are operational."

Usage Instructions
"Provide examples demonstrating how to call these functions within a Python script to facilitate integration into larger workflows."

Extensibility and Custom Features
Include any additional features or specific instructions.

Example:

"Implement error handling for common API errors."
"Add logging functionality to track API requests and responses."
"Structure the code to allow for easy addition of new API endpoints in the future."
